# Machine Learning Course at UNICAMP
This is a repository with my solutions for the Machine Learning Course at UNICAMP (first semester of 2017).

Every laboratory has an associated directory which contains the problem statement (README.md), the solution(s) (.py extension files) and a pdf file with the results.

System requirements includes:

* Python 2.7 / 3.0 (This dependents of the laboratory but minor changes are required to change between versions)
* Scikit-Learn
* Numpy
* Laboratory 5 needs NLTK library.
* Laboratory 1 needs Tensor FLow


The original problems were taken from Prof. [Jack Wainer'S](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~wainer/) personal page.
